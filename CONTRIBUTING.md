## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for constants

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

enum UserRole {
  ADMIN = 'admin',
  USER = 'user',
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
const user: any = { id: '1', name: 'John' };
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for props
- Follow the naming convention: PascalCase for components
- Export components as default when possible

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
interface IdeaCardProps {
  idea: Idea;
  onEdit?: (id: string) => void;
}

export default function IdeaCard({ idea, onEdit }: IdeaCardProps) {
  return (
    <div className="idea-card">
      <h3>{idea.title}</h3>
      <p>{idea.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use camelCase for utility files

```
‚úÖ Good
- idea-card.tsx
- IdeaCard.tsx
- utils.ts
- api-client.ts

‚ùå Avoid
- ideaCard.tsx
- idea_card.tsx
- Utils.ts
```

### Import Organization

```typescript
// 1. React and Next.js imports
import React from 'react';
import Link from 'next/link';

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { useUser } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// 3. Internal components and utilities
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';
import { ideasAPI } from '@/lib/api/ideas';

// 4. Types and interfaces
import type { Idea } from '@/lib/supabase/types';
```

### CSS and Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the utility-first approach
- Use custom CSS sparingly
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm">
  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900">Ideas</h2>
  <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
    Add Idea
  </Button>
</div>
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good test example
describe('IdeaCard', () => {
  it('displays idea title and description correctly', () => {
    const idea = {
      id: '1',
      title: 'Test Idea',
      description: 'Test Description',
      phase: 'inception' as const,
      tags: ['test'],
      created_at: '2024-01-01',
      updated_at: '2024-01-01',
      created_by: 'user1',
      workspace_id: 'workspace1'
    };

    render(<IdeaCard idea={idea} />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Test Idea')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Description')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onEdit when edit button is clicked', () => {
    const onEdit = vi.fn();
    const idea = { /* ... */ };

    render(<IdeaCard idea={idea} onEdit={onEdit} />);

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /edit/i }));

    expect(onEdit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(idea.id);
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test files
npm test IdeaCard.test.tsx
```
